    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    const playersCopy = players

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // players.splice(2);

    // console.log(playersCopy);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const slicePlayers = players.slice();

    console.log(slicePlayers);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const concatPlayers = [].concat(players);

    console.log(concatPlayers);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    spreadPlayers = [...players];

    console.log(spreadPlayers);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    players.splice(3);

    console.log(players);
    console.log(slicePlayers);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    
    const human = person; 

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    homosapien = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 50, name: 'Phil'});

    console.log(homosapien);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(homosapien)));
    console.log((JSON.stringify(homosapien)));

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
